## Ambient Light
This project showcases the use of the ambient light sensor in your phone's camera.
With just a few lines of code, you can now enjoy a day and night mode screen with cool animations that make your app stand out!

## How it works
This project uses the `camera` plugins in Flutter to access the ambient light sensor in your phone's camera. When the sensor detects that the ambient light level has changed, the app changes between the day and night mode screens, with cool animations that make the transition smooth and seamless.
